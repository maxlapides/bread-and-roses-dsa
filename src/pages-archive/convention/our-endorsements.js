          In addition to our proposals and our NPC slate, DSA’s Bread &amp;
          Roses caucus has endorsed a number of proposals at the DSA National
          Convention. We believe these candidates, resolutions,
          constitution/bylaws changes, and amendments will help strengthen DSA
          and root us more firmly in the multiracial working class.

        <h2>NPC Candidates</h2>

        <p>
          We encourage all delegates to vote for our five candidates — Marianela
          D’Aprile, Marsha Niemeijer, Megan Svoboda, Natalie Midiri, and Rachel
          Zibrat — in slots #1-5 on their ballot (preferably in an
          non-alphabetical order of the delegates’ choosing). Because the
          elections will be done by a ranked choice system, ranking our five
          candidates at the top of one’s ballot is very important to ensuring
          they win.
        </p>

        <p>
          Following these five candidates, we are proud to endorse the
          candidacies of Sean Estelle and Dave Pinkham. We are asking delegates
          to rank them #6 and #7 on their ballots, in an order of the delegates’
          choosing.

              utility in Chicago, and shares our vision for a strong DSA rooted
              in the working class that can make the fight for a Green New Deal
              a socialist one.
