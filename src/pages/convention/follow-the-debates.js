          As the 2019 DSA National Convention heats up, it can be difficult to
          follow all the debates and proposals being made. Between now and the
          start of the convention on August 2nd, 1,059 delegates have 33
          candidates for National Political Committee, 88 resolutions, and 38
          constitution and bylaws changes to sift through.
        </p>

        <p>
          In preparing for the convention, we in DSA’s Bread &amp; Roses caucus
          have put together this page to summarize what we see as the major
          debates and tendencies in the organization. We’ll update it
          semi-regularly between now and the convention as additional
          contributions to debates are made. We also recommend DSA members check
          out other summaries. Andrew Sernatinger (Madison DSA) has useful
          primers on{" "}

          .
        </p>

        <p>
          So far resolutions and debates have focused on DSA’s approach to the
          labor movement, electoral strategy, and competing visions for how to
          redesign the national organization. Our summary focuses on those
          debates for now. Delegates have also put forward, among other
          proposals, important resolutions to ground DSA’s work in struggles
          against racism, gender oppression, and imperialism; to fight for the
          Green New Deal; and to take on voter suppression, mass incarceration,
          police brutality, and anti-immigrant policies.

        <h2>Caucuses, Tendencies, and the NPC Race</h2>

        <p>
          Most members in DSA are not members of any caucus or tendency (we use
          tendency to refer to caucus-like formations that don’t use the label
          of &quot;caucus&quot;). However, a significant minority of active
          members and national delegates have found joining one to be useful. In
          an organization of almost 60,000 members, caucuses are a means to
          organize within and influence the organization&rsquo;s direction.

          In 2017, members of B&amp;R ran candidates for the NPC on a slate
          called Momentum and members of Build ran candidates for the NPC on a
          slate called Praxis. North Star tends to be associated with the
          leadership of DSA prior to 2016 and many of its members are also
          members of SMC. R&amp;R is made up of members who left Socialist
          Alternative in late 2018. SMC appears to be the largest caucus of
          active members based on its published membership list.
        </p>

        <p>
          A number of chapter-specific caucuses have also been formed, each of
          which will likely have a handful of delegates working in tandem at the
          convention. These include San Francisco’s{" "}

          <ExternalLink href="https://dsaemerge.org/">Emerge</ExternalLink>{" "}
          caucus. As far as we can tell, each of these chapter caucuses have a
          number of former members of Refoundation — a national caucus that
          positioned itself on DSA’s far left before it dissolved in late 2018.
        </p>

          sense of where the caucus is coming from, though it’s usually unclear

        <h3>The Debate So Far</h3>

        <p>
          At the 2017 DSA National Convention, DSA endorsed through the{" "}
          <ExternalLink href="https://www.dsausa.org/democratic-left/dsa_priorities_resolution_2017/">
            national priorities resolution
          </ExternalLink>{" "}
          a focus on rank-and-file organizing as part of its main orientation to
          labor work. The organization also officially launched the{" "}
          <ExternalLink href="https://labor.dsausa.org/">
            Democratic Socialist Labor Commission
          </ExternalLink>
          , which was designed to coordinate DSA’s national labor strategy.
          Since the election of its first Steering Committee in early 2018, the
          DSLC has made helping DSA members get union jobs a key part of its
          work — including{" "}
          <ExternalLink href="https://teachers.dsausa.org/">
            publishing a manual
          </ExternalLink>{" "}
          on how socialists can get rank-and-file jobs as teachers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consistent with the DSLC’s focus, all tendencies in DSA either support
          some continued orientation towards rank-and-file work (usually the
          canonical reference is to Kim Moody’s 2000 pamphlet:{" "}
          <ExternalLink href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/08/unions-socialists-rank-and-file-strategy-kim-moody">
            The Rank-and-File Strategy
          </ExternalLink>
          ) or have not taken a position. Bread &amp; Roses and the Libertarian
          Socialist Caucus have taken the{" "}

          </ExternalLink>{" "}
          in favor of the RFS. But a major question at the 2019 DSA convention
          will be the degree to which DSA remains focused on that vision as a
          top labor priority.
        </p>

        <p>
          Discussions about what kind of labor work DSA should prioritize has
          been brewing since the start of this year. Barry Eidlin
          (LA-DSA/B&amp;R) published a{" "}

          of the RFS in <i>Jacobin</i> in March. Andrew D. (Suffolk County DSA)
          published a close and{" "}

            somewhat critical reading

          by Luke Elliot-Negri (Nassau County DSA/SMC) that faulted the RFS for
          overemphasizing the importance of socialists getting union jobs at the
          expense of other tactics for rebuilding the labor movement — including
          taking staff organizing jobs. Kim Moody{" "}

          to local organizing conditions. Bread &amp; Roses weighed in again in

        </p>

        <h3>What’s at Stake in Atlanta</h3>

        <p>
          One notable feature of the convention is the widespread agreement
          among all proposals that labor should remain a key feature of
          DSA&#39;s work. Rather than adopting an overwhelming focus on
          electoral work, DSA takes a broader and more serious approach to class
          struggle.
        </p>

        <p>
          Starting from that very important baseline of agreement, the labor
          debate has been concretized into two main proposals for how the DSLC
          should conduct its work going forth (further amendments may help
          clarify lines of debate further) — Bread &amp; Roses&#39;s Resolution
          32 and Collective Power Network&#39;s Resolution 3. Both resolutions
          were drafted by members of the DSLC, propose hiring an organizer to
          support the work of the DSLC, and instruct the DSLC to help chapters
          develop stronger labor groups.
        </p>

        <p>
          An endorsement of the B&amp;R proposal would provide the &quot;clear
          strategy&quot; that the CPN resolution calls for but fails to
          articulate. According to the rank-and-file strategy advocated for by
          the B&amp;R resolution, the central focus of DSA&#39;s labor work
          should be to help develop and empower a growing layer of rank-and-file
          workers to fight the bosses and transform our unions into militant and
          democratic vehicles for class struggle.
        </p>

        <p>
          CPN's resolution proposes a reorganization of the DSLC and it sets
          three commendable (if very broad) goals of working within unions,
          focusing on strategic industries, and organizing the unorganized. But
          CPN&#39;s resolution says nothing about the need to politically
          transform existing unions from the bottom-up. Nor does it provide any
          clear answers for how to achieve these three goals or what tactics to
          prioritize given the current state of DSA and the labor movement.
        </p>

        <p>
          B&amp;R&#39;s resolution is informed by the belief that socialists can
          be most effective at taking on our class enemies and organizing the
          unorganized by working, wherever possible, within unions in strategic
          industries. While we support various tactics for rebuilding
          workers&#39; power — including salting unorganized industries and
          organizing new unions at our workplaces — our resolution establishes
          mechanisms to help DSA prioritize actively embedding ourselves into
          strategic industries and unions.
        </p>

        <p>
          B&amp;R&#39;s resolution is important because it offers clear
          instructions to the DSLC to help DSA activists become shopfloor
          organizers capable of helping revitalize the labor movement from the
          bottom up. We also recommend delegates vote for both resolutions
          because CPN&#39;s resolution reiterates commendable goals that are
          complimentary, not contradictory with our resolution.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additional proposals call for specific new organizing campaigns.
          Resolution 46 would have DSA support new organizing efforts in
          logistics, including supporting salting efforts. Resolution 68,
          proposed by some members connected to Build — including one candidate
          for NPC from the SUP slate — would have DSA call on unions to launch a
          new &quot;Operation Dixie&quot; to organize the South. Finally
          Resolution 67, coauthored by members of Build and San Francisco&#39;s
          Red Star Caucus, calls on the DSLC to do more to support organizing
          the unorganized.

            strategy — a dream that socialists and other progressives could
            realign the Democratic Party and make it a political institution
            rooted in and truly fighting for working-class people’s interests.
            By the early 2010s this commitment had waned, and in the 2017
            priorities resolution DSA dropped all mention of the possibility of
            transforming the Democratic Party.
          </p>

          <p>
            While realignment is out as a strategy that anyone in DSA will at
            least publicly defend, the organization remains committed to using
            the Democratic Party ballot line for most electoral campaigns. The
            rationale was{" "}

              convincingly articulated
            </ExternalLink>{" "}
            by Seth Ackerman in <i>Jacobin</i> back in 2016, and the tactic has
            basically been the unchallenged approach of almost all DSA chapters
            engaged in electoral work since. In sum, Ackerman made the case for
            building an electoral apparatus completely independent of the
            Democratic Party (DSA activists have viewed DSA as this apparatus)
            that runs candidates in party primaries as left-wing challengers.
            The approach also takes an agnostic and at times dismissive approach
            to the need for creating a ballot line independent of the Democratic
            Party in the future.

            DSA’s electoral strategy has been tested and honed in the two years
            following the 2017 convention in a number of impressive electoral
            wins and close loses. And in March, after a national referendum was
            conducted and 76% of members responding voted yes, DSA endorsed
            Bernie Sanders’s 2020 presidential campaign bid.
          </p>

          <p>
            There seems to be a generally shared commitment to continuing to use
            the Democratic ballot line, and a common understanding of the
            importance of electoral work. And most caucuses and tendencies seem
            to either support or passively accept DSA’s recent endorsement of
            Bernie. In fact a notable (and frankly regrettable) fact about the
            convention is that there are very few resolutions touching on DSA’s
            Bernie campaign. Key questions will not be addressed by the
            convention, including whether DSA activists should run to be Bernie
            delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Nevertheless, some
            differences remain on the question of long-term electoral strategy
            and how high a bar should be set for endorsements.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the question of long-term strategy, Socialist Majority Caucus
            tends to hew closest to the strategy outlined by Ackerman —
            including its aversion to talk of a new party down the line — while
            Bread &amp; Roses is more vocal about the need to break from the
            Democratic Party and commit to forming an independent party at some
            point in the future. Luke Elliot-Negri (Nassau County DSA/SMC)

            , has published a call for a class-struggle electoral strategy aimed
            at recruiting strong working-class candidates who identify as
            socialists and build working-class organization and power through
            their campaigns.

          <h3>What’s at Stake in Atlanta</h3>

          <p>
            By our count, more than 15 resolutions touch on DSA’s electoral
            strategy. Resolution 82 (&quot;DSA National Electoral Priority
            Resolution&quot;) proposed by, among others, three candidates from
            SMC’s slate for NPC would recommit DSA to making electoral work a
            national priority. It essentially continues DSA’s electoral work as
            it is set out in DSA’s 2017 priorities resolution and the NEC
            strategy document. The proposal also leaves to the NEC and the NPC
            the question of what criteria should be used when making national
            endorsements and what endorsements should entail.
          </p>

          <p>
            Resolution 31 (&quot;Class Struggle Elections&quot;) proposed by the
            Bread & Roses caucus also makes electoral work a priority for DSA,
            while calling on DSA to develop a candidate pipeline to recruit
            working-class candidates to run for office. It requires that
            candidates endorsed nationally by DSA identify openly as socialists,
            prioritize using their elected office as a platform for building
            working-class power, and commits DSA in the long-term to the
            strategic goal of launching an independent working-class party.
          </p>

          <p>
            Resolution 48 (&quot;Candidate Litmus Test&quot;) would commit DSA
            nationally to a much more rigorous set of criteria for making
            endorsements, including requiring that candidates identify openly as
            socialists, support a number of key economic and social reforms, and
            endorse Bernie Sanders. Resolution 49 (&quot;PAC Spending for
            Nationally Endorsed DSA Candidates&quot;) would make national
            endorsements more meaningful, by among other things committing DSA
            to donating money from its national PAC to endorsed candidates.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the convention endorses Resolution 82, it would be a vote of
            support for DSA’s existing electoral approach. Support for
            Resolutions 31, 48, and/or 49 would make DSA’s electoral strategy
            more specific than it currently is, and set a higher bar for
            national endorsements than currently exists. None of these
            resolutions are at odds, but delegates will have to decide what kind
            of instructions they want to give to the NEC for its work in the
            next two years.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition, DSA’s North Star Caucus has proposed Resolution 13
            which makes defeating Donald Trump a national priority in 2020.
            Though the resolution leaves the question of what defeating Trump
            would require open, in the past members of the North Star Caucus
            have been vocal defenders of lesser-evil voting in presidential
            elections — so the resolution may be intended to pave the way for a
            critical endorsement of the Democratic nominee should Bernie Sanders
            lose. That position is challenged by Resolution 15 (&quot;In the
            Event of a Sanders Loss&quot;) which would declare ahead of time
            that DSA will not endorse any other Democratic Party candidate
            should Bernie Sanders lose the primary.
          </p>

          <p>
            Looking to down ballot races, members of SMC, B&amp;R, and other
            independents have proposed Resolution 36 to support socialist
            challenges in District Attorney races. Resolution 87 sets new
            guidelines for the process of making endorsements.
          </p>

          <p>
            A host of resolutions seek to influence Bernie Sanders’s policy
            positions. Resolution 39 would petition Bernie Sanders to take a
            strong stance in support of a &quot;People’s Foreign Policy
            Platform&quot;. Resolution 59 would demand that all candidates
            running for president develop a policy for reparations for black
            people in the United States. And Resolution 74 calls on Bernie
            Sanders to adopt a stronger housing platform.

          <h2>Organizational Questions</h2>

          <p>
            As of the start of the 2019 convention, DSA has a fairly simple
            national structure. A sixteen member National Political Committee
            (with two representatives from the Young Democratic Socialists of
            America sharing a single seventeenth vote) is elected at biennial
            national conventions. The NPC acts as the national leadership
            between conventions, oversees the national office (including
            appointing the National Director), and makes national political
            decisions. The NPC and the national office are also supposed to
            support the organization’s 150+ chapters, which are then broken up
            into smaller working groups, committees, and (in bigger cities)
            neighborhood-based branches.
          </p>

          <p>
            This structure worked fairly well when DSA was a small organization
            with only a few hundred active members. The organization’s rapid
            growth however has strained it. As a result, many changes have been
            proposed.
          </p>

          <p>
            As these proposals become more fleshed out, and stronger cases are
            made on their behalf, we will update this section further. For now,
            five main constitution and bylaws changes deserve special notice as
            they would make the most sweeping changes to the national
            organization.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, two members of Socialist Majority Caucus have proposed the
            creation of a National Organizing Council via Constitution/Bylaws
            Change 31. The NOC would be a body of about 60 members plus the NPC,
            and would be the highest power between conventions. It would have
            the authority to oversee and reverse decisions of the NPC. The
            proposal also mentions the creation of regional organizations with
            the power to charter chapters, but does not detail what those
            regional organizations would look like. In this proposal, DSA
            chapters would be grouped into regions solely for the purpose of
            electing members of the NOC to represent their region. Although
            Bread &amp; Roses has not taken a position on the proposal, it has{" "}
            <ExternalLink href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd794FJgGKmVZwiXmI8_vaheTt0PV4oV5c2Z6kK95-81NrXLw/viewform?fbclid=IwAR17M4mDmBDZBDQBvET3UbYY8U85RxUZ0wnFDGjHqkbjvWdbEtm6NA-mE7Y">
              proposed an amendment
            </ExternalLink>{" "}
            to remove the NOC’s ability to amend the constitution and bylaws on
            the grounds that only the national convention should be able to do
            that.
          </p>

          <p>
            Four alternative constitution and bylaws changes have similar goals
            but approach the problem in different ways.
          </p>

          <p>
            Constitution/Bylaws Change 15, proposed by members of the North Star
            caucus, would increase the size of the National Political Committee
            to 28 members. While the simplest solution to expanding the national
            leadership, it lacks the regional representation that members may
            desire.
          </p>

          <p>
            Constitution/Bylaws Change 16, proposed by members of the Collective
            Power Network, creates a new National Organizing Council elected on
            a regional basis similar to what is proposed in Constitution/Bylaws
            Change 31. It also contains language to build and strengthen
            regional organizations. The proposal as we understand it potentially
            creates a situation where regions could be of very different sizes
            depending on which region each chapter affiliates with. If that
            happens, and if the proposal remains the same in that every region
            receives five representatives on the NOC, an undesirable &quot;DSA
            senate&quot; could be created in which members in smaller regions
            have proportionally much greater representation on the NOC.
          </p>

          <p>
            Constitution/Bylaws Change 33, proposed by members of the
            Libertarian Socialist Caucus, creates an &quot;Assembly of
            Locals&quot; (the &quot;AOL&quot;). The proposal is difficult to
            parse, though it appears to call for a leadership body of up to 400
            members and removes most powers from the NPC, which would be renamed
            &quot;the Board&quot;. It is hard to imagine how such a proposal
            could work effectively in practice, and if enacted the work of
            national DSA could be fatally hamstrung.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, Constitution/Bylaws Change 34, proposed by members of
            Build, reactivates the National Advisory Committee to act as a new
            intermediary leadership body. The controversial aspect of the NAC
            proposal, similar to Constitution/Bylaws Change 16, is that by
            giving every chapter, regardless of its size, a single
            representative on the NAC, it would also create a &quot;DSA
            senate&quot;.
