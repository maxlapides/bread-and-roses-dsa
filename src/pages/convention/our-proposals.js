          We in DSA&rsquo;s <Link to="/">Bread &amp; Roses</Link> caucus are
          excited to share three resolutions we drafted collectively for the
          2019 DSA National Convention, one on labor organizing and the DSLC,
          one on class-struggle election campaigns, and one on investing greater
          resources in political education. Bread &amp; Roses is also proud to
          endorse the Ecosocialist Working Group&rsquo;s{" "}

        </p>

        <p>
          These three resolutions and our support of the GND resolution are
          based on our analysis of DSA&rsquo;s{" "}

          years.

          We&rsquo;re asking for DSA members&rsquo;{" "}

        </p>

        <p>
          We&rsquo;re also proud to share an amendment to strengthen DSA&rsquo;s
          dues sharing program that supports small and new chapter.
        </p>

        <p>
          While these are the proposals we have decided to collectively endorse
          so far, we may endorse additional resolutions in the weeks to come,
          including resolutions that were written by caucus members but did not
          undergo the collective drafting and approval process that the three
          above did, and resolutions written by members outside of our caucus.

          popularity has only risen. We have also seen a small but significant
          shift in favor of down-ballot class-struggle electoral candidates like
          Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Julia Salazar, Jovanka
          Beckles, and the{" "}

          .
        </p>

        <p>
          Just as with the strike wave, we see this as a very promising
          development. But again, to build the movement we need, we need to grow
          our capacity exponentially. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re proposing a
          clear set of criteria for national DSA endorsement as well as a
          candidate pipeline program to help DSA develop strong class-struggle
          candidates. We see class-struggle candidates as those who &ldquo;use
          elections, public offices, and legislation as vehicles to encourage
          working-class organization, promote progressive legislation, and build
          support for democratic socialist ideas.&rdquo; The resolution also
          orients DSA&rsquo;s work in the Bernie Sanders campaign towards
          building independent working-class power.

        <p>
          In the past two years we have seen a major upswing in labor militancy
          across the country. In many cases, DSA members played leading roles in
          organizing strikes and other collective action. But to truly build a
          strong working-class movement, workers will have to take on the boss
          on a greater scale than ever before.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our resolution on labor organizing and the DSLC will build DSA&rsquo;s

        <p>
          We should all be proud of DSA&rsquo;s enormous growth and its outsized
          impact over the last few years. To build a durable movement, we need
          to improve our collective ability to analyze the strengths and
          weaknesses of our movement and capitalist class rule. We also need to
          better understand the history of and debates within the socialist
          movement.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          That is why we are proposing a resolution to consolidate and develop
          political education materials and to make them more easily accessible
          to chapters. By taking what materials they find useful, and modifying
          them as they wish, chapters can avoid spending time reinventing the
          wheel. This will both make political education more accessible to more
          members, and free up time at the chapter level for other organizing
          tasks.{" "}

        <p>
          A radical transition is needed towards a completely decarbonized
          economy in the next 12 years in order to save our planet. No challenge
          is of greater urgency both to humanity as a whole and to the socialist
          project. It is of the utmost important that DSA participate in the
          fight to build an ecologically sustainable society.

          is our best hope to prevent a climate catastrophe. We recognize
          however that building this new society will require a massive fight
          against the fossil fuel industry and members of the capitalist class
          who profit from our current carbon-powered economy. We strongly
          support the Green New Deal priority campaign being proposed by
          DSA&rsquo;s Ecosocialist Working Group and coauthored by members
          across DSA&rsquo;s tendencies, including members of DSA&rsquo;s Bread
          &amp; Roses caucus. This campaign proposes a vigorous fight on the
          scale of DSA&rsquo;s other major priority campaigns to popularize and
          win a robust, anti-capitalist version of the Green New Deal.

        <p>
          Resolution #55 is a strong proposal to support DSA&rsquo;s small and
          new chapters. It increases national DSA&rsquo;s support to these
          chapters through DSA&rsquo;s dues sharing program. We believe it{" "}

          to proposed alternatives.
        </p>

        <p>
          We and members of the Socialist Majority Caucus who coauthored this
          amendment with us believe that Resolution #55 can be strengthened by
          making allowances for chapters that do not have bank accounts. Our
          amendment would instruct the national organization to give chapters
          that do not have bank accounts their dues share through other means,
          potentially including prepaid debit cards, credit towards purchasing
          DSA supplies, and&#47;or fiscal cosponsorships by other DSA chapters.
