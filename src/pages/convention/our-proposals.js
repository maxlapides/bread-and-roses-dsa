          We in DSA&rsquo;s <Link to="/">Bread &amp; Roses</Link> caucus are
          excited to share three resolutions we drafted collectively for the
          2019 DSA National Convention, one on labor organizing and the DSLC,
          one on class-struggle election campaigns, and one on investing greater
          resources in political education. Bread &amp; Roses is also proud to
          endorse the Ecosocialist Working Group&rsquo;s{" "}

        <p>
          These three resolutions and our support of the GND resolution are
          based on our analysis of DSA&rsquo;s{" "}

          years.

          We&rsquo;re asking for DSA members&rsquo;{" "}

        </p>

        <p>
          We're also proud to share an amendment to strengthen DSA&rsquo;s dues
          sharing program that supports small and new chapter.
        </p>

        <p>
          While these are the proposals we have decided to collectively endorse
          so far, we may endorse additional resolutions in the weeks to come,
          including resolutions that were written by caucus members but did not
          undergo the collective drafting and approval process that the three
          above did, and resolutions written by members outside of our caucus.

          popularity has only risen. We have also seen a small but significant
          shift in favor of down-ballot class-struggle electoral candidates like
          Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Julia Salazar, Jovanka
          Beckles, Lee Carter, and the{" "}

          .
        </p>

        <p>
          Just as with the strike wave, we see this as a very promising
          development. But again, to build the movement we need, we need to grow
          our capacity exponentially. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re proposing a
          clear set of criteria for national DSA endorsement as well as a
          candidate pipeline program to help DSA develop strong class-struggle
          candidates. We see class-struggle candidates as those who &ldquo;use
          elections, public offices, and legislation as vehicles to encourage
          working-class organization, promote progressive legislation, and build
          support for democratic socialist ideas.&rdquo; The resolution also
          asks the organization to orient our work towards the Bernie Sanders
          campaign in a way that builds independent working class power, whether
          Bernie ultimately wins or loses.

        <p>
          In the past two years we have seen a major upswing in labor militancy
          across the country. In many cases, DSA members played leading roles in
          organizing strikes and other collective action. But to truly build a
          strong working class movement, workers will have to fight the boss
          even more frequently and even more aggressively.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our resolution on labor organizing and the DSLC will build DSA&rsquo;s
          capacity to identify, train, and connect{" "}

            Resolution #33: Invest in Political Education
          </ExternalLink>
        </h2>
        <p>
          We should all be proud of DSA&rsquo;s enormous growth and its outsized
          impact over the last few years. To build a durable movement, we need
          to improve our collective ability to analyze the strengths and
          weaknesses of our movement and capitalist class rule. We also need to
          better understand the history of and debates within the socialist
          movement.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          That is why we are proposing a resolution to consolidate and develop
          political education materials and to make them more easily accessible
          to chapters. By taking what materials they find useful, and modifying
          them as they wish, chapters can avoid spending time reinventing the
          wheel. This will both make political education more accessible to more
          members, and free up time at the chapter level for other organizing
          tasks.{" "}

            Resolution #34: Ecosocialist Green New Deal Priority
          </ExternalLink>
        </h2>
        <p>
          A radical transition is needed towards a completely decarbonized
          economy in the next 12 years in order to save our planet. No challenge
          is of greater urgency both to humanity as a whole and to the socialist
          project. It is therefore of the utmost important that DSA participate
          in the fight to build an ecologically sustainable society.
        </p>

        <p>
          A Green New Deal is our best hope to prevent a climate catastrophe. We
          recognize however that building this new society will require a
          massive fight against the fossil fuel industry and members of the
          capitalist class who profit from our current carbon-powered economy.
          We strongly support therefore the Green New Deal priority campaign
          being proposed by DSA&rsquo;s Ecosocialist Working Group and
          coauthored by members across DSA&rsquo;s tendencies. This campaign
          proposes a vigorous fight on the scale of DSA&rsquo;s other major
          priority campaigns to popularize and win a robust, anti-capitalist
          version of the Green New Deal.

            Amendment to Resolution #55: Grassroots Fundraising and Small
            Chapter Growth
          </ExternalLink>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Resolution #55 is a strong proposal to support DSA&rsquo;s small and
          new chapters, by increasing national DSA&rsquo;s support in the form
          of dues sharing to these small chapters.
        </p>

        <p>
          We and members of the Socialist Majority Caucus who coauthored this
          amendment with us believe that Resolution #55 can be further
          strengthened by making allowances for chapters that do not have bank
          accounts. Our amendment would instruct the national organization to
          give chapters that do not have bank accounts their dues share through
          other means, potentially including prepaid debit cards, credit towards
          purchasing DSA supplies, and/or fiscal cosponsorships by other DSA
          chapters.
