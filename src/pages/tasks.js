        <h2>Preamble</h2>
        <p>
          Today the world is more unequal than ever before. Forty two
          billionaires hold the same amount of wealth as the bottom half of the
          world’s population. In the U.S., the so-called recovery since the 2008
          crash has restored profits for financiers and big business many times
          over, but the poorest 90% of U.S. residents are still worse off than
          they were in 2007. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
          Change report warns we might have as little as a decade to keep global
          warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius — or face generations of ecological
          and social catastrophe. Globally, the far-right is on the rise, and
          socialism is the only political force capable of uniting millions to
          combat this reactionary tide. The stakes for our movement could not be
          higher.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, in the U.S., politicians govern in the interests of the
          capitalist class. With Donald Trump at the helm, they will continue to
          advance an extreme anti-worker, pro-business, and ecologically
          destructive agenda while stoking racism, xenophobia, and sexism in
          support of state repression and political exclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          While deepening inequality, the dismantling of public institutions,
          and state repression in the form of mass incarceration and mass
          deportations have politicized millions, establishment Democrats have
          predictably refused to organize this progressive base. Even after
          winning the House, Democrats lack the political will to confront
          Republicans. Hitched to billionaire donors, they remain committed to a
          program of tepid reforms and a strategy of rhetorical gestures that
          will never succeed in building a working class movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of this political context, a new Left has emerged: thousands of
          mostly young, newly politicized people have joined the Democratic
          Socialists of America (DSA) after Bernie Sanders’s spectacular 2016
          primary campaign and a wave of teachers’ strikes swept the nation in
          2018. Democratic socialism is resurgent in the United States and
          around the world, and the movement is re-drawing political lines. Just
          six years ago Barack Obama was attacked by the business press as a
          “socialist” for insisting on a market-based health insurance scheme.
          Today, abolition of the health insurance industry through Medicare for
          All is the most popular political demand in the country. Four years
          ago the “socialist” label was a political death sentence. Today,
          democratic socialists are winning elections on bold working-class
          platforms, and Sanders is the most popular politician in the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Democratic socialists believe it’s impossible to have democracy and
          social justice under capitalism. We want a society where everyone has
          what they need to survive and flourish — education, food, healthcare,
          housing — where decisions about what to produce, and how to produce
          and distribute it, are made democratically, and where every person
          regardless of gender, race, or cultural background has the opportunity
          to develop to their full human potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Socialists look to the working class&#8211;the vast majority of
          society, who need to sell their labor power to survive and whose
          workplace conditions are established by capital&#8211;as the only
          social force that has both the interest and the potential power to
          break the power of the capitalists and transform our society. Only an
          organized, united, militant, and class-conscious working class has the
          structural power and material interest to extract transformative
          concessions from the ruling class and ultimately take over society to
          run it democratically and in the interest of the majority.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in the last forty years the working class has become increasingly
          quiescent. Defeat at the hands of an all-out bosses’ offensive
          beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s has left the working-class
          majority divided, disorganized, and resigned to the status quo.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe socialists must help to rebuild the power of the working
          class — this is the primary project of socialists today. We must work
          to bring the many disparate elements of the working-class majority
          into a class-conscious social force, willing and able to fight in
          solidarity for our own interests. Any hopes of living in a socialist
          world lie in the prospect of building such a working class. No matter
          how excited we may be about the rise of a proudly socialist left,
          everything rests on what comes next: can socialists fuse our ideas
          with a militant, diverse workers’ movement?
        </p>
        <p>
          Rebuilding the power of the working class is already underway. The
          dismantling of the meager welfare state combined with the downward
          slide of wages and living conditions has inspired a new generation of
          workers to challenge both the economic logic of neoliberalism and the
          political class that led us down this path. The growing popularity of
          Bernie Sanders, the historic teacher strike wave, and the stunning
          growth of DSA are all evidence that elements of the working class are
          moving left and willing to fight. The role of the still small
          political Left, represented most of all by DSA, is to help deepen this
          process. We believe that organized class struggle — the direct
          conflict between capitalist and workers in the workplace, streets,
          schools, media, and at the ballot box — is the primary mechanism for
          strengthening the power of the working class. Class struggle raises
          class consciousness while uniting all oppressed and exploited groups
          against a common foe: capitalists.
        </p>
        <p>
          DSA can encourage, support, and sometimes even lead these class
          struggles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The actually existing Left, however, is not yet fully suited to this
          work. As the left was expunged from common life through McCarthyism
          and later through neoliberal politics, it retreated to the campus,
          divorced from the aspirations of working people. Meanwhile, neoliberal
          ideology eliminated class and class politics from the American
          political vocabulary. As a result, most working people, including
          activists politicized in their unions or in mobilizations against mass
          incarceration, deportation, anti-LGBTQ legislation, or abortion
          restrictions, do not view the socialist movement as relevant to their
          lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today we have a historic opportunity to change that — for socialist
          politics to reenter the mainstream and for a working-class movement to
          rise.
        </p>
        <p>
          To advance class-struggle politics in 2019, given the threats and
          opportunities that face us today, DSA should prioritize: participating
          in elections and Sanders’s 2020 run in particular; campaigning for
          Medicare for All; building a democratic, militant current in the labor
          movement; fighting against the oppression and prejudice that keep
          workers divided; launching a Green New Deal campaign; and developing a
          more robust political education program. Each of these will advance
          the socialist project.

      <Element name="bernie-sanders" id="bernie-sanders">
        <h2>Bernie Sanders and Class-Struggle Elections</h2>
        <p>
          We don’t believe we can elect socialists to office who can simply
          legislate in socialism — or even social democracy — from above. The
          view that we could, often called electoralism, ignores two essential
          features of our society.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the state under capitalism is not simply a neutral tool that
          can be wielded by whoever holds a legislative majority. Rather,
          legislatures and administrators are under immense structural pressure
          to advance a pro-business agenda and to block or water down
          progressive state action. Since billionaires and their corporations
          control most of the economic resources in society, they can buy a
          large degree of direct influence over elections. Even in countries
          with strict campaign finance laws, capitalists’ private control over
          investment decisions grants them an enormous source of indirect
          structural power over the decisions of democratically elected public
          officials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, electoralism misunderstands the primary source of socialists’
          power: organized, militant workers. Elections can be a vehicle for
          class struggle, and redistributing power and resources to workers will
          indeed require an ambitious legislative agenda and ultimately a
          socialist political party taking state power and initiating a formal
          transition to democratic socialism. But the power to achieve and
          defend these gains rests primarily in organized workers and their
          capacity to mobilize a mass social base to win these demands.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, the last three years have proven that elections and
          elected offices are essential terrain for socialists. Democratic
          socialist candidates and officeholders, Bernie Sanders chief among
          them, have used their substantial platforms to grow an increasingly
          class-conscious constituency, by competing against despicable
          corporate candidates, politicizing class struggle issues, and
          propagandizing against class enemies. This year, Sanders used social
          media, town halls, and op-eds promoting the grievances of Amazon
          workers, and legislation titled The Stop BEZOS Act, to target the
          Amazon CEO’s obscene wealth and his workers&#8217; poverty wages. The
          result was Bezos&#8217;s raising wages for hundreds of thousands of
          Amazon employees to avoid further public scrutiny.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through propaganda and an inspiring legislative agenda, socialists
          should use elections and elected offices to extend class struggle.
          Election campaigns can spur radicalization and working-class
          organization that must also be rooted outside the state, in workplace
          organizing and social movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          DSA should exclusively run, endorse, and campaign for class struggle
          candidates. These are candidates who present a serious and explicit
          working-class challenge to the political establishment and the
          corporate-friendly status quo. These races help to raise class
          consciousness and worker organization by clarifying lines of class
          conflict. And by offering a viable alternative, class struggle
          candidacies can inspire ordinary working-class people to become
          involved in the political process in large numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2018 DSA-backed class-struggle electoral campaigns laid bare the
          glaring contradictions in the Democratic Party coalition. By following
          DSA labor activists’ lead and pushing to repeal the New York State ban
          on public employee strikes, the Taylor Law, Julia Salazar and Cynthia
          Nixon forced not only Andrew Cuomo but also so-called progressive
          Mayor Bill DeBlasio and even public sector union leaders to come out
          in favor of the ban. East Bay DSA’s support of Jovanka Beckles against
          Clintonite carpetbagger Buffy Wicks included producing
          buffywicks.money, a website dedicated to revealing Wicks’s billionaire
          supporters, both Democrats and Republicans.
        </p>
        <p>
          DSA should not support class compromise progressives, such as Beto
          O’Rourke or Elizabeth Warren. These candidates do present a “harm
          reduction” opportunity to stave off the worst of the Republicans and
          Democrats. But since they incorporate into their political coalitions
          elements of business and the business-friendly Democratic Party
          establishment, they obscure rather than clarify lines of class
          conflict. Therefore, while they might be the lesser evil in their
          specific races, they undermine the essential political process that is
          underway: strengthening and politicizing the working class on the
          basis of class struggle. The Left’s unabashed class politics are a
          more effective tool to beat Republicans than anything Democratic Party
          operatives have at their disposal, and it is up to DSA to prove this
          to the Democrats&#8217; base and activist layer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Democratic socialists elected to public office should act as
          organizers and campaigners first and as legislators second. Their
          prime goal should not be to “work with” their colleagues or, at this
          early stage, to think they will get legislation passed. It will be
          extremely difficult for them to resist the co-optive pressures of the
          party establishment, and we should expect to lose some officeholders
          to those pressures. Our candidates should think of themselves as
          class-struggle fighters dropped behind enemy lines, with an
          orientation outward to their base, which needs to remain mobilized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn in the UK offer an excellent model of how
          socialists elected to office can be effective mobilizers and
          campaigners for an ambitious reform agenda.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our class struggle perspective means we are committed to political
          independence from the capitalist class. In the near term, this means
          rejecting a strategy of reforming, transforming, or “realigning” the
          Democratic Party and instead building an electoral, fundraising, and
          mobilization infrastructure that is independent of Democratic Party
          institutions and NGOs. Still, DSA should maintain tactical flexibility
          with regard to ballot lines. Depending on the local context,
          socialists should run as independents, socialists, Green Party
          candidates, or in the Democratic primary — whichever ballot line will
          best allow us to run class-struggle candidacies. Many municipal
          elections are nonpartisan, making it easier to run campaigns not
          connected to the Democratic machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the medium term, political independence means laying the
          foundations for a mass working-class political party, independent of
          the Democrats and their ballot line. Such a party will be essential
          for sustaining organization and mobilization in social movements and
          in electoral politics, deepening political education and socialist
          cadre development, and fusing disparate currents and activities of
          struggle into coherent and strategic political action. Exactly how or
          when such a party will come about — through a dramatic split in the
          Democratic Party coalition or through some other process — we cannot
          now predict. But by carrying out class struggle politics in 2019 — in
          elections, in the statehouse, by fighting for Medicare for All, by
          building a militant labor movement, and by building working-class
          resistance to oppression — we can accelerate the delegitimization of
          both Republican and Democratic parties and widen the space for an
          independent alternative party in coming years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The perspective outlined here translates into three concrete tasks for
          DSA in 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, DSA should call on Bernie Sanders to run in the 2020 Democratic
          presidential primaries and endorse his candidacy as soon as he
          announces. A Sanders run will only further the campaigning he began in
          2015 and has kept up since. This time, however, he will begin the
          campaign in a much stronger position: as the most popular politician
          in the country. Backed by an enthusiastic national DSA campaign, a
          2020 Sanders run has the potential to politicize millions of workers
          through class struggle politics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, DSA should adopt a simple platform of policy demands at our
          2019 national convention. Demands should include a universal job
          guarantee, Medicare for All, social housing, tuition-free college,
          ending mass incarceration, progressive immigration reform, transition
          to a clean energy economy, repeal of Taft-Hartley, defending voting
          rights, and democratic reform of the Constitution. Such a platform
          should guide our 2019 and 2020 endorsements and give DSA a clearer and
          more unified political identity — based in class struggle and
          solidarity, within and beyond the electoral realm. A detailed platform
          can provide a level of ideological coherence, guide and unite our
          campaign work at the national and local level, and bring us closer to
          establishing democratic socialists as a fully independent political
          and electoral force. This platform should be limited in its breadth
          and used as a means of judging potential DSA candidates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, DSA should develop a serious and coordinated strategy of
          candidate recruitment. The National Election Committee should send out
          a call ASAP for ideas for strong potential candidates among DSA’s
          activist base, and meet with chapter leaders about developing a plan
          to assess the viability of the candidate, convince the candidate to
          run, and ensure the candidate will be a tribune for socialism in the
          campaign. The National Election Committee should focus on identifying
          candidates in states where the growth of socialist electoral projects
          appears most promising, particularly in the Rust Belt. This will allow
          us to rely increasingly on organic DSA candidates, who see DSA as
          their primary organization and see their primary mission as candidates
          and in office as advancing democratic socialism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, at the 2019 DSA convention we should promote a resolution
          stating that while DSA currently supports class-struggle candidates
          running on the Democratic Party ballot line, it considers that the
          Democratic Party, like the Republican Party, is a party permanently
          tied to the capitalist class. Therefore, DSA sets itself the strategic
          goal of helping build a mass workers&#8217; party in the US.
        </p>
        <p>
          This resolution would state that in the current period, the level of
          class struggle and organization is still far too low to immediately
          achieve this goal. But important steps can and should be taken today
          to use elections to move in this direction and rebuild a mass
          socialist pole in U.S. political life.
        </p>
      </Element>

      <Element name="medicare-for-all" id="medicare-for-all">
        <h2>Recommit to the Medicare for All Campaign</h2>
        <p>
          Perhaps no other demand since the postwar era has provoked as powerful
          an opposition as the demand for Medicare for All. The ruling class
          knows just how much the socialization of health insurance threatens
          its power. If socialists wish to realize that threat, we need to
          devote even more energy to campaigning for Medicare for All. The
          business community has the money, the media, the politicians, and the
          courts. We have members and the real grievances of a frustrated
          working class.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with other demands for universal social programs, for housing,
          education, and jobs, Medicare for All demonstrates three core
          principles of class-struggle politics. First, capitalist markets
          cannot justly distribute public goods like healthcare, education, and
          housing. They should be taken out of the market and put under public
          democratic control. In other words, these basic needs should be
          decommodified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, public programs should be universal and inspire solidarity
          across the whole working class. That means no eligibility requirements
          or means testing; everyone is included. Medicare for All is a natural
          and binding political demand for solidarity across all sectors of the
          class. From white collar workers with college degrees and unionists
          with strong contracts, to low-wage service workers and the unemployed,
          we all feel the crisis in health care. Black workers, white workers,
          immigrant and native born all suffer under the barbarism of the
          American health care system. In the words of Quentin Young, founder of
          Physicians for a National Health Program, “Everybody in, nobody out.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, universal, public, and democratically controlled social
          programs should achieve massive redistribution of wealth and power.
          Free and high-quality healthcare, housing, and education should be
          paid for by taxing the rich and their corporations. This way we can
          usher in the end of austerity politics, which have meant lavish tax
          cuts for the rich and corporations and shrinking social programs for
          everyone else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Few other demands have the potential to unite this broad a coalition
          of the working class, but, more important, no other demand is now so
          popular that it can make that potential a reality. Now effectively a
          litmus test for Democratic candidates, Medicare for All even has the
          support of a majority of Republican voters. With Bernie Sanders’s
          championing, Medicare for All has skyrocketed from an impossibility to
          an eventual inevitability. It will be the most popular policy of his
          2020 campaign and delegitimize both Democratic and Republican
          establishments.
        </p>
        <p>
          DSA can play a major role in pushing this demand forward and should
          recommit to what has been the largest coordinated campaign in its
          history. The Medicare for All campaign is a testament to what DSA can
          be, an all-volunteer effort with no real financial resources that has
          mobilized thousands of members in over a hundred chapters. Medicare
          for All will be won through mass education campaigns, pressure tactics
          in key congressional districts, ties with the left wing of the labor
          movement, door-to-door canvassing, and most important, mass
          demonstrations and strikes in the healthcare industries. Without
          socialists insisting on uncompromising class-struggle politics in the
          fight, the demand will be co-opted or deferred by corporate Democrats
          and liberal NGOs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Medicare for All campaign should expand to even more DSA chapters.
          None is too small or too remote to contribute. Chapters should develop
          stronger ties to our single-payer allies in the union movement, and
          DSA unionists should push their unions to join the fight and recruit
          their coworkers to DSA’s campaign activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          DSA should sponsor speaking tours and town halls across the country.
          Our Medicare for All Campaign Committee (MFACC) should coordinate a
          speakers bureau of high-profile speakers.
        </p>
        <p>
          These events should culminate in a summit with leading unions and
          social movement organizations to develop a unified Medicare for All
          movement combining a legislative strategy and a ground game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last, our MFACC should identify short-term political goals at the
          state and municipal levels to provide benchmarks for locals. We see
          Austin DSA’s paid sick leave campaign and the unique opportunity in
          New Jersey to expand Medicare to the entire state as two potential
          local examples. Despite our doubts about the efficacy of any
          state-level single-payer plan, we nonetheless see the state
          single-payer bills in California and New York as good organizing
          tools. The MFACC should develop a research team to explore
          opportunities for state-level actions and create a database that
          activists can use to develop creative state-level work.

        <h2>Work in the Unions, Support Strikes</h2>
        <p>
          DSA today is still largely confined to a relatively small section of
          downwardly mobile, well-educated, white and young workers and
          professionals. If democratic socialists are to have a serious impact
          on developing the capacities and desire of the working class to wage
          class struggle, we must embed ourselves and our ideas solidly in the
          largest and most diverse institution of the organized working class,
          the labor movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Socialists and radicals have always formed the core of labor’s
          “militant minority,” offering skills, commitment, strategic clarity,
          independent organizational support, and inspiring political vision to
          working-class struggles. As the working class is the central agent of
          progressive social transformation, the workplace is the central site
          to build working-class power. By bringing a class-struggle perspective
          to workplace organizing, socialist labor activists can begin to cut
          through the class collaboration championed by most of the U.S. labor
          bureaucracies and push for active, worker-led organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          High-up union officials are often hesitant or openly resistant to
          worker-led militancy, progressive politics, and union democracy. They
          would rather maintain the comfortable (for them) system of deals made
          through Democratic Party officials and friendly relations with
          employers, which are much easier to control than strikes or shop-floor
          actions that involve the leadership of the rank and file. Class
          struggle entails workers’ own organization and leadership, not
          arrangements among bosses and bureaucrats made behind closed doors.
          DSA should always stand with movements pushing for militancy,
          democracy, and class struggle, such as Labor Notes, Teamsters for a
          Democratic Union (TDU), and United Caucuses of Rank-and-File Educators
          (UCORE).
        </p>
        <p>
          Socialist movements have recognized that left politics are a
          non-starter without deep involvement in the labor movement. It is at
          the workplace that workers can develop both power and a sense of their
          power. Workplace organizing has some advantages over community-based
          or electoral efforts: there is an obvious community of interest in
          which shop floor organizers have natural access to those they&#8217;re
          trying to reach, with never a shortage of issues. At the same time,
          unions at their best are also a way to make ties in surrounding
          communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We see the teachers strike wave as a prime opportunity for DSA
          unionists to organize and agitate. There is no greater tool than the
          strike to not only extract concessions from capital and the state but
          also to teach workers where their true source of power lies. Not only
          are teachers located in a strategic sector capable of having an
          outsized influence on politics and society, their specific goals
          — from West Virginia to Los Angeles &mdash; are class-wide demands.
          Teachers across the country are demanding more than wage increases for
          themselves, they are pushing to raise the social wage for the whole
          class. That is, teachers have insisted upon better funding for public
          schools, wage hikes for all public employees, smaller class sizes, and
          a health insurance system that works for all.
        </p>
        <p>
          A critical aspect of the 2018 teachers strikes was their rank-and-file
          character. Officials in the teachers unions are particularly connected
          to the Democratic Party establishment and have an interest in
          preventing confrontation organized from below. These strikes were
          initiated and organized by rank-and-filers who managed expertly to
          work with and around officials to achieve their goals&#8211;while
          winning public support.
        </p>
        <p>
          If teachers strikes continue, DSA should make a priority of supporting
          them and participating in a national movement to save public
          education.
        </p>
        <p>
          DSA teachers and other K-12 school workers should encourage the tender
          shoots of the strike movement, with the support of the Labor
          Commission (DSLC) and the Democratic Socialists Teachers network.
          Whether or not there are DSA members in the ranks of a striking
          teachers union, DSA members should participate in pickets, organize
          strike support, raise money, and amplify strikers’ political demands.
          In such scenarios, members may be particularly helpful in organizing
          community support. The DSLC and the teachers network should coordinate
          regular calls and develop shop floor strategies and a “rapid-response”
          system for impending workplace actions that will allow DSA chapters to
          quickly mobilize. While DSA chapters should support strikes in any
          sector, strikes in public education are a unique opportunity to
          catalyze a wide political awakening.
        </p>
        <p>
          DSA should develop labor groups, branches, or committees within
          chapters, led primarily by rank-and-file workers. Labor branches serve
          a dual role. First, they give socialist union members a place to
          strategize about their unions and to develop a specifically socialist
          pole within their local labor movements. Second, they provide a
          comfortable place to recruit worker activists into DSA, or at least to
          introduce them to socialist ideas. Third, chapter labor groups are a
          channel for DSA members who are not in unions to learn about the labor
          movement, support labor organizing and solidarity work, and receive
          the training and support to either organize new unions or find
          strategic rank-and-file union jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
          DSA should support labor education for union and non-union members
          alike. This could include chapter educationals/night/day schools on
          the basics of labor and helping to organize local Labor Notes
          &#8220;Troublemakers Schools&#8221; and &#8220;Secrets of a Successful
          Organizer&#8221; trainings. Such schools give those not in the labor
          movement a clear picture of what is and isn&#8217;t happening in
          today&#8217;s labor movement and connect socialists with exactly the
          sort of worker activists DSA should be recruiting.
        </p>
        <p>
          DSA should encourage members to seek jobs in union workplaces where
          they can work with co-workers to foment class struggle in ways large
          and small. It makes sense for members to choose a few key industries
          to concentrate in, to multiply our efforts rather than scattering
          them. For different reasons, for now those priorities should include
          K-12 public education, health care, and logistics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chapters should develop strong support for members who seek these
          jobs, including ongoing education, mentoring, and networking beyond
          the local level. DSA members who are already union members can be a
          big resource here. And DSA should encourage members to organize with
          their co-workers to form unions where they are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, DSA’s labor activism should include deep collaboration with
          the revival of Labor for Bernie and the Labor Campaign for Single
          Payer. Both these groups offer socialists an opportunity to work with
          union members, creating pressure on many of the same Democrat-friendly
          union bureaucracies that early and undemocratically endorsed Hillary
          Clinton in the 2016 primary over the protests of their members. Along
          these lines, DSA&#8217;s National Political Committee should convene a
          meeting with Labor for Bernie and those unions who will likely be
          major players in a Sanders campaign to discuss a national strategy and
          to establish stronger institutional relationships with these unions.

        <h2>Fight Oppression</h2>
        <p>
          The programs described above are one step toward fighting oppression
          and prejudice, which are used to pit workers against each other in the
          struggle to make ends meet. Capitalists, reactionaries, and their
          political cronies employ prejudice, state repression, and material and
          political exclusion — for example, mass incarceration, redlining, vote
          suppression, deportation, wage differentials, inadequate public
          services, and abortion restrictions — to increase profits, cut their
          taxes, or sow divisions among working people. These strategies have
          only escalated under Trump.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many people first come to political consciousness and activism through
          their experience of or struggles against racial and gender injustice.
          In order to make the socialist movement more diverse, DSA must make
          clear in words and deeds that not only do socialists take seriously
          fights against oppression but also that working-class unity and
          class-struggle politics are the most effective strategy to combat
          oppression. Socialists have always been at the center of battles
          against racism and sexism, fighting to integrate the labor movement,
          oppose Southern white supremacist terrorism, and spark the Civil
          Rights movement. We can demonstrate to a new generation of newly
          politicized workers that the socialist movement is their rightful
          political home.
        </p>
        <p>
          The program described above — fighting for Medicare for All, building
          a militant and politically independent labor movement, and running
          insurgent working-class candidates — is an indispensable element of
          any anti-oppression agenda today. The ongoing legacies of racial and
          gender oppression are manifest in appalling inequalities that serve to
          entrench prejudice. People of color and immigrants are far more likely
          to be poor, uninsured, burdened by student debt, or homeless. Working
          women face high barriers to abortion, may be dependent on
          relationships to remain insured or housed, and still do the
          lioness&#8217;s share of childcare and eldercare. Meanwhile, the
          economic power of employers, landlords, banks, and insurance companies
          enables them to discriminate against, harass, and underpay
          working-class women, people of color, and immigrants who fear that
          complaining or quitting their job risks deportation, homelessness, or
          loss of health insurance. These injustices and insecurities would be
          deeply undermined by free and universal social guarantees of housing,
          healthcare, education, childcare, pensions, and good jobs, and by a
          growing and militant labor movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we can go further. Socialists can fight oppression head on by
          including demands and agitation particularly oriented to oppressed
          groups within our class-wide organizing or campaigns. The Chicago
          teachers strike of 2012 and the contract campaign by Los Angeles
          teachers today, as well as the campaigns of Bernie Sanders, Alexandria
          Ocasio-Cortez, and Julia Salazar, show how class-based movements
          benefit by incorporating specific demands around racial justice. The
          platforms of the candidates DSA backs should include anti-oppression
          demands such as ending cash bail, repealing the Hyde Amendment, or
          abolishing ICE.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last dozen years, from the giant immigration marches of 2006 to
          the nationwide protests against police brutality in 2014 and 2015,
          have shown that hundreds of thousands of people can come together in
          the streets to fight oppression. These protests have opened
          Americans&#8217; eyes about citizenship rights and police brutality.
          DSA should also support campaigns such as defending Roe v. Wade, to
          convict killer cops, and for immigration rights. Socialists can bring
          important assets: the strategic clarity of class unity, independent
          mass action tactics, concrete demands that address the problem head on
          and blame capitalists (rather than vague sentiments like “Love Trumps
          Hate&#8221;), and independence from the Democratic Party and from
          foundations and NGOs. In general, our approach should be to help build
          movements that have the potential to attract significant support.

      <Element name="green-new-deal" id="green-new-deal">
        <h2>Launch a Green New Deal Campaign</h2>
        <p>
          As the recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
          Change has found, we face an immense and urgent set of tasks to
          mitigate climate change and repair then environmental degradation
          caused by capitalism. A radical transition is needed towards a
          completely decarbonized economy in the next 12 years in order to hold
          global temperatures to a 1.5C increase above pre-industrial levels —
          beyond which devastation from climate change threatens billions.
          Global emissions must be cut by 50% by 2030, an order of magnitude
          more ambitious than current efforts. Meanwhile even a 1.5C temperature
          rise will trigger significant changes in our global ecology, and we
          will need to undertake massive projects of adapting our existing
          infrastructures (cities, agriculture, transportation, water, etc.) to
          become resilient to the changes already locked in for our world.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as socialists, we know that climate change is not simply a
          technical problem with a technocratic solution. Mitigating the worst
          and adapting to the inevitable are political problems that require
          political solutions. They will involve large-scale redistribution of
          wealth and power from fossil-fuel capitalists to the working class.
          And so, to save the planet, socialists look to build a mass movement
          of the working class — the only social force with the power to enact
          such a massive, progressive transformation at the expense of
          capitalists and political elites. That’s why the primary task of
          socialists should be building the power of the working class to carry
          out ambitious fights for a better world.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the Gilets Jaunes movement in France has shown, we can’t trust
          liberal technocrats like Macron to provide the solutions to climate
          change. Regressive carbon taxes that let corporations off the hook and
          squeeze the budgets of working people. Climate policies that call on
          working people to simply tighten their belts and don’t offer
          alternative solutions for an abundant, ecologically sustainable life
          for all will be met with indifference at best or even, as in France,
          mass resistance from below. We need a climate program that empowers
          the working class, rather than just shaming them into using less
          carbon in a neoliberal capitalist framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          DSA must thus be educating, agitating, and organizing a working-class
          social base around the demand for a Green New Deal. Such a campaign
          should be based on the following five principles: (1) full
          decarbonization by 2030, (2) full employment by 2025, achieved by
          direct federal creation of tens of millions of jobs in energy
          transition, environmental impact mitigation, as well as low-carbon
          sectors like socialized healthcare and education, (3) public,
          democratic ownership of major energy systems and resources, (4)
          massive investment in climate adaptation and resilience for our
          communities, agriculture, and transportation systems, and (5) paid for
          by progressive taxes on dirty industries, corporations, and the
          wealthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          For decades, the environmental left has focused its energy on
          well-meaning but small-scale projects. On the progressive left, this
          has involved things like introducing some solar or wind power into our
          energy system, lobbying for some carbon taxes or carbon markets, or
          rallying around non-binding international climate accords. The more
          anarchist-inspired left has either tended to embrace individualistic
          acts of moving “off the grid,” or what Naomi Klein has called
          “Blockadia,” using physical resistance to stop pipeline projects and
          the like.
        </p>
        <p>
          But a true transition to an ecologically sustainable civilization will
          necessarily involve both millions of workers reconfiguring the basic
          infrastructure of our society, and millions more willing to shut down
          the capitalist economy to force fossil profiteers to concede.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can’t simply be against pipeline projects. We need to be for a
          concrete, viable program that tens of millions of ordinary working
          people — whose priorities are rightly their immediate prospects for
          jobs, healthcare, housing, and education — can get behind. More to the
          point, we need to rally around such a program fast — efforts must be
          underway by the early 2020s to have a hope if keeping the world at
          1.5C warming. The Green New Deal’s newfound popularity, driven in part
          by democratic socialist Congressionwoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,
          means that the moment is right for socialists and working-class
          movements to take the lead on mass demands for a just transition to an
          ecological economy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting in 2019, DSA should build up a national campaign for a Green
          New Deal. Recognizing the amount of time, effort, and infrastructure
          that this project would require, it might make sense to attach the
          bulk of that organizing to a broader campaign for Bernie Sanders — the
          only likely presidential candidate who consistently frames the climate
          issue as one of class conflict and could actually fight for its
          passage as president — and then maintain an independent GND campaign
          focused on research, media, and public actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building a massive and militant working-class movement is absolutely
          necessary for the ecological transition we need. So we should not see
          a Green New Deal as somehow a “separate issue” from Medicare for All,
          the labor movement, or class-struggle electoral campaigns, and should
          work to incorporate this demand into our broader work.

          One of the key jobs of a socialist organization is political
          education. Historically, the socialist movement has offered a coherent
          perspective to help people make sense of the world and, crucially, to
          change it. Our strategies should develop from a political and economic
          analysis; for that, we need to learn from the rich history and
          theoretical debates of the socialist movement. DSA should be the
          political home and school where socialist activists can develop their
          capacity to read, write, and debate about politics and strategy. We
          need cadre able to tackle every kind of political and organizational
          problem and eager to participate in internal democracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          DSA should commit sizable resources to a national Political Education
          Committee tasked with designing education for members and chapters.
        </p>
        <p>
          We should support chapters in organizing regular Socialist Night
          Schools and periodic Day Schools and other study groups. These
          sessions can both educate our members and offer an easy-entry activity
          for recruiting new members.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, DSA should produce pamphlets on the issues in our platform,
          to help members articulate our democratic socialist vision.
